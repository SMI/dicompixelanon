# XXX NOTE XXXX
#
# This file is specific to Python 3.10 on CPU, but with older versions of
# easyocr, pydicom, Pillow, numpy and and pytorch, but it does need direct
# links to torch on pytorch.org.
#
# These requirements are more easily installed using "uv pip".
#
boto3
# pydicom v3 has some breaking changes we've not checked yet,
# also, deid is not ready for pydicom v3:
pydicom<3.0
pylibjpeg
pylibjpeg_libjpeg
pylibjpeg_openjpeg
deid
pydal
pymongo
tqdm
# You will need Pillow<10.0 if using easyocr<1.7
Pillow<10.0
# pytesseract is only tied to 0.3.8 if using python 3.6
pytesseract
# easyocr cannot handle numpy v2
numpy<2.0
# easyocr gives Illegal Instruction if torch is newer than 1.11.0
# see https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR/issues/1174
# Direct links to CPU version, but NOT on pypi.org so not suitable inside safe haven
